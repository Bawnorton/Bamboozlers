## Notes
* Specific data elements were not listed for Data-Flow diagrams as they have not yet been decided. 
  A general idea of what data may be transferred can be derived from the listed tasks.
* Attributes and methods listed in the UML Class Diagram are focused mostly on the User, 
  and may be updated as more information comes to light.
* Data types and scope were not included for the UML Class Diagram; these may be decided later through exploration,
  and locking down now may be a foolhardy decision.
